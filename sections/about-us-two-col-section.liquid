    <h2>Our Story: A Personal Journey That Sparked a Global Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Wellness Extract began with a heart-warming story of compassion, determination and love. Our founder,
                Virender Dass, embarked on this journey inspired by his own motherâ€™s battle with cancer. He firsthand
                witnessed the painful experiences of a cancer patient and struggled to find high-quality, scientifically
                backed supplements to support his mother.
      <br><br>
      This gut-wrenching journey awakened in him a greater purpose: to bridge the gap in wellness and develop
 
                products that give people the strength to take control of their health.
      <br><br>
      What started as a hope to help one person has now shaped into a global movement to render better health
 
                solutions for generations across the globe.
