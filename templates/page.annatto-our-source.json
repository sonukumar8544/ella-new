            "text": "<p>Annatto is a vibrant condiment derived from the seeds of the plant known as<strong> Achiote.</strong> It is also known as Bixa Orellana. It is more commonly used as a <strong>natural food coloring agent</strong> that gives yellow or orange color to food products such as dairy products, baked goods, breakfast cereals etc. The color of Annatto comes from various carotenoid pigments, mainly<strong> Bixin</strong> and<strong> Norbixin</strong>, found in the reddish waxy coating of the seeds. Annatto is also known for its<strong> medicinal properties</strong> and is used in various forms as a <strong>healing agent. </strong></p><p><strong>Annatto has also recently been the key of the greatest Vitamin E creation ever! </strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Barrie Tan discovered the purest and the most potent source of Vitamin E antioxidant called Tocotrienols from the Annatto seeds.</strong> He mentions Annatto as a ‘<strong>One Plant Wonder</strong>’ in his book, ‘The truth about Vitamin E’, as it contains <strong>100% Tocotrienols</strong>, that is, it is completely <strong>free of Tocopherols </strong>which interfere with lipid absorption and metabolism. There are four variants of Tocotrienols: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, amongst these,<strong> Gamma and Delta are the most effective molecules based on research.</strong></p><p><strong style=\"color: #086b92; text-align: center; display: block;\">Annatto is the only known plant-based source of active Delta and Gamma Tocotrienols, also making Annatto a supreme source of this powerful antioxidant.</strong></p><h2><strong>Annatto as a Food Additive</strong></h3><p>Annatto has numerous applications as a food additive for its coloring properties. It is added to various food products, including cheese, butter, snack foods, and baked goods, to give them an orange or yellow hue. It is <strong>100% natural</strong> and considered <strong>healthier</strong> than synthetic food colorings. In addition to its coloring properties, some food products use annatto as a <strong>natural preservative.</strong> The <strong>antioxidant properties</strong> of annatto can help to prevent spoilage and extend the food shelf life. It is heat-stable; it can withstand high temperatures during food processing without breaking down or losing its color. It adds a mild, light sweet peppery taste with a hint of bitterness to edibles. </p><p>It has been used in <strong>traditional medicine</strong> for its <strong>anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</strong> Almost 70% of food coloring agents are derived from it; the color comes from compounds called carotenoids (which also act as an antioxidant), pigments found in the seed’s outer layer. </p><p><strong>Annatto is also known for its use as a spice in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine.</strong> The seeds are often ground into a powder or made into a paste and added to dishes such as stews, rice, and beans. The flavor of annatto has been described as slightly peppery and nutty, with a hint of sweetness.</p><p>Currently, Annatto enjoys <strong>GRAS status (Generally, Recognized as Safe)</strong> by Food and Drug Administration. It is also endorsed as a food coloring agent in the European Union and other countries worldwide.</p><h2><strong>Annatto: The Ancient Superfood</strong></h3><p>Annatto is a <strong>versatile plant </strong> that has been used by indigenous populations for centuries for its <strong>medicinal and culinary properties</strong>. Its rich history and numerous health benefits have earned it the nickname of the <strong>\"Ancient Superfood.\"</strong> The annatto seeds are coated with a red color derived from the carotenoid <strong>bixin</strong>. This antioxidant </strong>supports eye health</strong> and may <strong>prevent eye diseases</strong> such as cataracts and macular degeneration. We already understand the importance of antioxidants in our metabolism, but our ancestors also recognized this fact, albeit through different sources of information.</p><p>Annatto paste, made from the seeds, has been utilized to treat various conditions such as headaches, upset stomach, irritable bowel syndrome, heartburn, asthma, bronchitis, skin blemishes, burns, and other skin irritations. <strong>While the seeds are primarily known for their medicinal and antioxidant properties, the leaves are also edible and rich in fiber and calcium, promoting bone health and maintaining a healthy digestive system</strong>.</p><h2>Annatto as a Natural Cosmetic</h3><p>Annatto has been used as a cosmetic for thousands of years and is commonly known as the <strong>\"Lipstick Plant\"</strong> because of its red seeds. People have been using Annatto, for its naturally vibrant hue, to paint their bodies. This tradition of using annatto as body paint dates back to the era of the ancient Mayans. Since most cosmetic brands these days are migrating towards more natural, healthier, and sustainable replacements, <strong>Annatto has proven to be a top choice for many cosmetic manufacturers in terms of working as a substitution for synthetic colorants</strong>. These days, it is often used in organic makeup products such as lipsticks, eye shadows, and blushes. It is also used in the <strong>hair-care industry</strong> to give a natural-looking color to the hair. \nAdditionally, this <strong>versatile dye is considered a safe additive by the FDA.</strong></p><h2><strong>Annatto-derived Tocotrienols – Why so Special? </strong></h3><p>Annatto is more than just a condiment and a natural dye; it is a <strong>rich source of vitamin E</strong>, specifically tocotrienols, the most superior form of vitamin E. <br><br><strong style=\"color: #086b92; text-align: center; display: block;\">The Wellness Extract vitamin E contains authentic and pure DeltaGold® Tocotrienols, which are formulated using a patented natural evaporative method that does not involve harsh or synthetic chemicals, petrochemicals, or solvents to extract the Tocotrienol vitamin E from the Annatto seeds.</strong></p>"

Dietary Vitamin E is an essential lipid-based antioxidant which is essential for protection against oxidative stress. Our body needs antioxidants just like an army needs superior weapons to fight. The right kind of antioxidants are our weapons to fight any damage to our body and support healthy aging.",
        "description2": "Vitamin E is an essential micronutrient to create and sustain human life. As a powerful fat-soluble cell antioxidant, it is a strong protector against free radicals. It can work wonders if the supplement contains the right molecule. Vitamin E is highly beneficial for our foundational health specifically in cardiovascular, bone, metabolic, and skin health. Parts of it can be obtained through certain food and some parts only through dietary supplements. As we age, our body has to work harder to absorb the nutrients from daily diet. Vitamin E is an essential micronutrient which can be consumed through food, but has a low antioxidant action in a standard meal especially because a certain part of Vitamin E is most likely missing.",

Vitamin E is made up of two main groups: Tocopherols and Tocotrienols  (lesser known). Both consist of 4 isomers each –Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Tocopherols have been around for a long time and can be obtained through many common foods for example, palm, rice, grains, and much more. Whereas, Tocotrienols are a more recent and important discovery.",
        "description2": "The defense mechanism of Vitamin E Tocotrienols protects 95% of lipid cells from oxidative damage. Dr. Barrie Tan has studied both of these molecules individually and found through research that Tocotrienols have almost twice the amount of antioxidant activity than Tocopherols. However, they are missing in 99% of vitamin E supplements available in the market at present. This is because Tocopherols are much more readily available through common foods and therefore easier to make. In conclusion, we are still missing out on the 50 TIMES stronger form of Vitamin E – TOCOTRIENOLS!",

Tocotrienols may be 50 TIMES more potent than Tocopherols based on their molecular structure alone. But the limitations came in finding a source of PURE Tocotrienols.
